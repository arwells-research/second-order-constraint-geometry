\section{Comparison with Related Frameworks}
\label{app:comparison-frameworks}

This appendix situates second-order constraint geometry ($\Sigma_2$) relative to existing formalisms in quantum foundations and open-system theory. The intent is not to claim priority or replacement, but to clarify the \emph{distinct role} played by $\Sigma_2$ as a diagnostic and classificatory layer.

Many established frameworks successfully model dynamics, probabilities, or causal structure. $\Sigma_2$ addresses a different question: \emph{when does a reduced, state-based description fail to faithfully represent admissibility without symmetry-breaking augmentation?}

Table~\ref{tab:comparison-frameworks} summarizes these relationships.

    \toprule
    \textbf{Framework} &
    \textbf{Primary Object} &
    \textbf{Sufficiency Criterion} &
    \textbf{Relation to $\Sigma_2$} \\
    \midrule
    
    Standard Quantum Mechanics &
    Instantaneous state $\rho(t)$ &
    \emph{Predictive} sufficiency: $\rho(t)$ fixes future statistics &
    $\Sigma_2$ does not challenge dynamical correctness; it diagnoses when predictive sufficiency fails to imply \emph{admissibility} sufficiency. \\
    
    Non-Markovian Dynamics &
    Augmented state or memory kernel &
    Restored Markovian closure via state enlargement &
    $\Sigma_2$ classifies when such augmentation restores prediction only by breaking admissible-history symmetries. \\
    
    Consistent Histories &
    Sets of histories $\{h\}$ with decoherence functional &
    Consistency of probability assignments over histories &
    Complementary: CH addresses probabilistic consistency; $\Sigma_2$ addresses representational sufficiency of reduced descriptions. \\
    
    Path Integral Formulation &
    Sum over trajectories &
    Global amplitude assignment &
    $\Sigma_2$ constrains admissibility of trajectories rather than computing amplitudes. No conflict with path-integral methods. \\
    
    Process Matrices / Quantum Combs &
    Higher-order maps on operations &
    Causal or operational consistency &
    $\Sigma_2$ is agnostic to causal ordering; it diagnoses failures of state-based sufficiency independently of causal structure. \\
    
    Causal Sets &
    Primitive causal relations &
    Causal consistency &
    Orthogonal: $\Sigma_2$ does not posit causal structure as fundamental, but constrains admissibility given fixed dynamics. \\
    
    Thermal Time Hypothesis &
    State-dependent notion of time &
    Thermodynamic consistency &
    Compatible: $\Sigma_2$ constrains admissible histories prior to time parametrization. \\
    \midrule
    
    \textbf{$\Sigma_2$ (This Work)} &
    \textbf{Admissible histories $\mathcal{H}$} &
    \textbf{\emph{Faithful} sufficiency:} factors through state without symmetry breaking &
    \textbf{Diagnostic and classificatory layer identifying structural limits of state-based descriptions.} \\

\paragraph{Interpretive neutrality.}
The classifications in Table~\ref{tab:comparison-frameworks} are intentionally interpretation-agnostic. Whether one adopts Everettian, consistent-histories, operational, or pragmatic open-systems viewpoints, the $\Sigma_2$ diagnostic applies whenever a reduced description is employed and admissibility depends on trajectory structure not factorizable through instantaneous state.

\paragraph{Scope.}
Nothing in this comparison asserts that $\Sigma_2$ is universally required. Closed systems, Markovian open systems, and many coarse-grained models remain faithfully state-sufficient. $\Sigma_2$ becomes relevant precisely when predictive completeness is achieved only by representational augmentation that breaks verified admissible-history symmetries.
